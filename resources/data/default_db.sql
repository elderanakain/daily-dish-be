Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. The Croutons. Make your own. Tearing, not cutting the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes. The Lettuce. Use whole leaves; they provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure. The Cheese. Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts. The Assembly. Skip the tongs.

INSERT INTO public.meal VALUES (6, 'Beef Chili', 'This is a chili recipe that you can make on a weeknight in under an hour. Lots of other recipes call for simmering for at least an hour, sometimes even more! The reality of that is tough, so we\''ve perfected this chili to be done in just 40 minutes. If you prefer a thicker chili that develops flavors over a low and slow heat, follow this recipe but simmer it at a lower heat for longer.Make it ahead. Chili is one of those dishes that tastes even better the next day. If you want to make it ahead of time, just be sure to let it come to room temperature before putting it an airtight container and storing it in the fridge. Leftover will last 3 to 5 days. Double it. Need to feed a big crowd? This recipe is easy to double (or triple!). Spice is king. Everyone knows a good chili has a complex flavor; this is thanks to a bunch of different spices at work. Cooks swear by all sorts of spices in their chili—everything from cinnamon to mustard powder—but these are the four we\''ll always make a pot with: chili powder, cumin, dried oregano, and paprika. Beef can be swapped. If you love the heartiness of a beef chili, but are trying to eat less beef, ground turkey or chicken totally works with this recipe. If you\''d prefer Vegetarian Chili we\''ve  you covered there, too. To bean or not to bean? Beans in chili are HOTLY contested in Texas. Texas Chili is beanless (and pretty spectacular) . But the rest of the country seems to love beans, including us—so we\''re all for it! We use kidney beans in this recipe, but black, pinto, even white beans work.

INSERT INTO public.meal VALUES (7, 'Pork Loin Roast', 'Pork can be intimidating to cook because it has a bad rep for being bland and boring. But if you cook it right, it can be extremely good. Good enough for a spot on your holiday table in fact. This is our favorite roasted pork loin recipe, and below are answers to the questions we get asked the most. Is there a difference between pork loin and pork tenderloin? Yes. Though both cuts are lean, uniform in shape, and mild in flavor, a pork loin roast is usually bigger and meatier. Do I need to sear it? You could, but in our opinion, it\''s not at all necessary because there\''s no skin. To get the caramelized crust effect, we spread the whole thing with butter and brown sugar and broil it just before slicing. How much should I buy? A 3- to 4-lb. pork loin roast should be plenty serve 6 to 8 people. But we\''re not against making it during the week and enjoying leftovers (preferably in a sandwich with herbed mayo) throughout the week. What are the best flavors to add to pork? Woody herbs like thyme and rosemary infuse a lot of fragrant flavor into otherwise bland meat. Mustard is always classic (we love grainy Dijon-style!) and pairs nicely with brown sugar. Also, butter. Always butter. What temperature am I aiming for? We always recommend using an instant meat thermometer when cooking big hunks of meat. For pork, the magic number is 145°.Do I need to let it rest? Yep! Just like beef and chicken, resting the meat is necessary for holding in all those juices.', 'https://daily-dish-be.herokuapp.com/static/sample_loin_roast_image.jpg', '2020-05-24 15:03:20');

We kept things super simple with shredded rotisserie chicken, rice, beans, and cheese. But let me be clear when I say, You can do whatever you want. I\''m currently dreaming of a pulled pork burrito with pickled jalapeños and esquites.

When researching recipes online, many use ginger, soy sauce, sugar, and garlic. There are often green onions involved, sometimes other veggies. Here, I obviously took many liberties. First and foremost, I transformed the stir-fry steak dish into a meatball and ramen skillet. One thing I kept the same: cornstarch. It makes the meat crispy and caramelized on the outside, and it helps thicken the sauce. If you don\''t have any on hand (or you forgot to pick some up), feel free to skip it.

When cooking the shrimp, make sure you have a single layer. If you overcrowd the pan, you risk steaming and overcooking…which would lead to sad rubbery shrimp. Cooking in batches may seem annoying, but shrimp cooks quickly! You only need about 2 to 3 minutes per side for it to turn pink.

And I could quite possibly house the entire 30ish tacos this recipe yields, if I were told they\''d be my last. But where did fish tacos come from? The Indigenous people of coastal Mexico have likely been making fish tacos for thousands of years, but fried fish tacos in came into play much later. It\''s thought that Japanese fisherman who immigrated to Baja, California (a coastal Mexican state on the Baja California Peninsula) in the 50\''s and 60\''s introduced their technique for tempura frying, helping to inspire the fried fish tacos we know and love today.', 'https://daily-dish-be.herokuapp.com/static/sample_tacos_image.jpg', '2020-10-27 17:53:20');

The crust is honestly one of our favorite parts and it\''s simple to make! Crushed graham crackers (the finer the better), melted butter, a little sugar, and salt - that\''s it!

We don\''t bake pre-bake our crust because once the entire cheesecake is baked and then chilled, the crust adheres to the filling and the butter hardens back up to give you a nice sturdy crust.

This oven-baked method will ensure your pork has a delicious crust and a perfectly cooked interior. Just follow these simple rules and prepare yourself to reconsider everything you know about this weeknight-friendly cut. Another sure fire winner? Smothered Pork Chops! 1. Buy them bone-in and thick. Typically, bone-in pork chops are thicker than those with the bone removed. A thin pork chop is difficult to cook perfectly with this method, because of the hard sear you give both sides before it goes in the oven. If a chop is too thin, by the time you\''ve seared both sides, the thing is practically overcooked! Choosing a thick chop allows you to get a nice golden sear on both sides and a perfectly cooked tender center.', 'https://daily-dish-be.herokuapp.com/static/sample_pork_chop_image.jpg', '2020-11-24 06:13:20');
